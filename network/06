# Get the complete path of the file that contains the IP address of the DNS server youâ€™re using
cat "/var/run/resolv.conf"

# Deduction
# Old Unix tools expect to find the DNS server IP in "/etc/resolv.conf". This is an autogenerated file in modern subsystems, including this Mac.
# The MacOS uses a sophisticated "scoped routing" subsystem of DNS queries, controlled by the "System Configuration" system, and mDNSResponder. There is more for me to learn about this.
# You can confirm that it is autogenerated by running the above command, and the file output will state that it is automatically generated. running ls -l "etc/resolve.conf" will also reveal that it is symbolically linked to "/var/run/resolve.conf"
# The directory "/var/run" refers to "per-user temporary files and caches" It's a place to store temporary or cached files, such as the resolv.conf that is automaticall generated.
# The "/etc" directory is the folder that should contain all system configuration files in it, which is why the resolv.conf file in here is a link to the "/var/run"
# To view DNS configuration used by this system, run "scutil --dns"
