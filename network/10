# Identify the network devices between your computer and the who.int domain
traceroute who.int

# Traceroute allows you to trace the path of packets sent from your machine to 
# each of the systems between you and the destination, in this case, who.int domain.
# It uses the IP protocol `time to live` field and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED
# response from each gateway along the path to some host. ICMP stands for Internet Control
# Message Protocol.
# By default, traceroute routes three packets of data to test each hop, which explains
# the three time values. These times refer to the amount of time taken for a packet
# to reach its destination and route back an ICMP message to the source.
# Some hops may only return a set of 3 stars. This can mean 1 of 2 things:
# 1. The device at that hop was not configured to reply to ICMP/UDP traffic, but the message was passed on nonetheless.
# 2. The packets were dropped due to an issue on the network.
# Since traceroute completed successfully, then it most likely means the responses with stars (*)
# were due to the devices not being configured for ICMP/UDP traffic.
