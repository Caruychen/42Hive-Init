# Figure out the exact size of each folder of /var in a humanly understandable way followed by the path of it.
sudo du -sh /var/*

# the du utility shows file system blog usage for each file argument.
# the h option will give human readable output. 
# in order to not list the size of all files, and only show the summary of
# folder sizes in /var we use -s. That would also need the argument to be
# /var/*, otherwise it only shows the size of /var
