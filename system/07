# Figure out the PID of the SSHD service.
cat /var/run/sshd.pid

# Alternatively, run:
# ps aux | grep "/usr/sbin/sshd" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'
# ps aux will show all the processes running for all users
# grep "/usr/sbin/sshd" shows the sshd process from the outputs
# Sometimes the grep process will also show up, so grep -v grep makes sure that only the sshd
# process is searched
# the PID is the second element from awk
