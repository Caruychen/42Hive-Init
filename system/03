# What file has to be modified to make it permanent?
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname NEW_HOSTNAME

# The above command is available on newer version of Linux distros
# For older distros, hostnames can be changed by editing the names as follows:
vi /etc/hostname
# After editing the hostname, use
vi /etc/hosts
# to edit the IP to hostname mapping
# finally, the system needs to be rebooted.
